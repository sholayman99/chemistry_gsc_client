          History of the periodic table of chemical elements:
        </span>{" "}
        In 1669 German merchant and amateur alchemist Hennig Brand attempted to
        created a Philosopherâ€™s Stone; an object that supposedly could turn
        metals into pure gold. He heated residues from boiled urine, and a
        liquid dropped out and burst into flames. This was the first discovery
        of phosphorus. In 1680 Robert Boyle also discovered phosphorus, and it
        became public. In 1809 at least 47 elements were discovered, and
        scientists began to see patterns in the characteristics. In 1863 English
        chemist John Newlands divided the then discovered 56 elements into 11
        groups, based on characteristics. In 1869 Russian chemist Dimitri
        Mendeleev started the development of the periodic table, arranging
        chemical elements by atomic mass. He predicted the discovery of other
        elements, and left spaces open in his periodic table for them. In 1886
        French physicist Antoine Bequerel first discovered radioactivity.
        Thomson student from New Zealand Ernest Rutherford named three types of
        radiation; alpha, beta and gamma rays. Marie and Pierre Curie started
        working on the radiation of uranium and thorium, and subsequently
        discovered radium and polonium. They discovered that beta particles were
        negatively charged. In 1894 Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh
        discovered the noble gases, which were added to the periodic table as
        group 0. In 1897 English physicist J. J. Thomson first discovered
        electrons; small negatively charged particles in an atom. John Townsend
        and Robert Millikan determined their exact charge and mass. In 1900
        Bequerel discovered that electrons and beta particles as identified by
        the Curies are the same In 1903 Rutherford announced that radioactivity
        is caused by the breakdown of atoms. In 1911 Rutherford and German
        physicist Hans Geiger discovered that electrons orbit the nucleus of an
        atom. In 1913 Bohr discovered that electrons move around a nucleus in
        discrete energy called orbitals. Radiation is emitted during movement
        from one orbital to another. In 1914 Rutherford first identified protons
        in the atomic nucleus. He also transmutated a nitrogen atom into an
        oxygen atom for the first time. English physicist Henry Moseley provided
        atomic numbers, based on the number of electrons in an atom, rather than
        based on atomic mass. In 1932 James Chadwick first discovered neutrons,
        and isotopes were identified. This was the complete basis for the
        periodic table. In that same year Englishman Cockroft and the Irishman
        Walton first split an atom by bombarding lithium in a particle
        accelerator, changing it to two helium nuclei.In 1945 Glenn Seaborg
        identified lanthanides and actinides (atomic number is greather than
        92), which are usually placed below the periodic table.
