        The word “chemistry” has been derived from the Greek word “chemeia”,
        meaning, “the art of metal working”. Obviously modern chemistry involves
        a great deal more than this. Chemistry has become an interdisciplinary
        science, and today no scientific work can escape chemistry. Chemistry
        plays a pervasive role in all our lives. Hundreds of materials that we
        use directly and indirectly everyday are products of chemical research.
        The development of fertilizers, which is one of the major areas of the
        chemical industry, has profound effect on agricultural production.
        Another major area of the chemical industry is the pharmaceutical, or
        drug, industry. Who among us has not used an antibiotic to cure an
        infection or various drugs to alleviate the pain associated with dental
        work, accidents, or surgery? Modern medicine which rests firmly upon
        chemistry, has increased our life expectancy. It is hard to believe that
        little over a century ago many people actually died from simple
        infections and other diseases that we seldom hear anymore. Perhaps the
        chemical products most familiar to all of us are plastics. About 50
        percent of industrial chemists are involved with the development or
        production of plastics. There is hardly an activity in our daily life
        that does not include some plastic products. Chemistry also plays a
        major role in materials science-from the manufacture of computer chips
        to paper and wood products to structural metals such as steel and
        lightweight titanium and aluminum alloys for ships and aircrafts.
